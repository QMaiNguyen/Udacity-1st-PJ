### Instalation <a name="installation"></a>
The code is saved in .ipynb file and can be run with any tool that support this file format.
The notebook uses only basic data libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

### Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
While exploring the stackoverflow 2021 dataset, I focused on the programming languages and as a fresh developer, I tried to answer the questions below:
- What are the best languages to start?
- Should I focus on a small set of languages or should I know them all?
- Will my earning increase with seniority?

### File Description <a name="file"></a>
All 3 questions are answered in one notebook and the data that I used for this exercise is also available in this repository.

### Results <a name="results"></a>
The findings of this project has been published here.

### Acknowledgements <a name="acknowledgements"></a>
This project use data from [Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).\
The code is inspired by Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree Program.
